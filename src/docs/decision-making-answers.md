# Decision-Making and Technical Questions Answers

## Decision-Making Reports

### 1. Backend Choice

**Why Firebase Functions was chosen:**

Firebase Functions was selected as the backend solution for the Collab Workspace App for several key reasons:

1. **Integration Speed**: Firebase provides a tightly integrated ecosystem where Authentication, Database (Firestore), and Cloud Functions work seamlessly together. This allowed for rapid development without building custom integration layers.

2. **Serverless Architecture**: Firebase Functions offers a serverless architecture that automatically scales based on demand, eliminating the need for server provisioning, maintenance, and capacity planning.

3. **Cost Efficiency**: The pay-as-you-go pricing model is cost-effective for a growing application, especially during the initial stages when usage patterns are unpredictable.

4. **Real-time Capabilities**: Firebase's real-time features align perfectly with the collaborative nature of the workspace app, enabling instant updates across clients.

5. **Developer Experience**: Firebase's comprehensive SDKs and documentation significantly reduce development time and complexity.

**Comparison with alternatives:**

- **Laravel API**: While Laravel offers a robust framework with excellent ORM capabilities, it requires more setup time, server provisioning, and doesn't provide built-in real-time capabilities essential for our collaborative app.

- **Supabase Edge Functions**: Though Supabase is gaining popularity and offers PostgreSQL with real-time capabilities, Firebase's maturity, documentation, and broader feature set made it a safer choice for our timeline.

- **Python Flask/FastAPI**: These frameworks offer excellent performance and flexibility but would require additional infrastructure setup and integration with authentication and database services, increasing development time.

### 2. Database Choice

**Why Firebase Firestore was chosen:**

Firestore was selected as the database solution for the following reasons:

1. **Real-time Synchronization**: Firestore's real-time listeners (`onSnapshot()`) enable instant data synchronization across clients, which is crucial for a collaborative workspace application.

2. **Offline Support**: Firestore's built-in offline capabilities allow users to continue working without an internet connection, with automatic synchronization when connectivity is restored.

3. **NoSQL Flexibility**: The document-based structure provides flexibility for evolving data models, allowing us to adapt to changing requirements without complex migrations.

4. **Scalability**: Firestore automatically scales with usage, handling high read/write throughput without manual sharding or scaling configurations.

5. **Security Rules**: Firestore's declarative security rules provide fine-grained access control directly at the database level, enhancing security without additional backend code.

**Comparison with alternatives:**

- **Supabase (PostgreSQL)**: While PostgreSQL offers robust relational capabilities and Supabase adds real-time features, it doesn't match Firestore's offline support and would require more complex server-side code for the same functionality.

- **MySQL**: A traditional relational database would require significant additional infrastructure for real-time capabilities and offline support, increasing both development time and operational complexity.

- **MongoDB**: Though similar in document structure to Firestore, it lacks the integrated authentication, security rules, and offline capabilities that Firestore provides out of the box.

### 3. Storage (for attachments)

**How files would be stored and why:**

For the Collab Workspace App, **Firebase Storage** would be the optimal choice for storing file attachments for the following reasons:

1. **Seamless Integration**: Firebase Storage integrates directly with Firebase Authentication and Firestore, maintaining consistent security rules and user permissions.

2. **Client SDKs**: Firebase provides robust client libraries for uploading and downloading files directly from the client, reducing server load.

3. **Security Rules**: Similar to Firestore, Firebase Storage offers declarative security rules that can be aligned with our data model permissions.

4. **Resumable Uploads**: Built-in support for resumable uploads improves user experience when dealing with larger files or unstable connections.

5. **CDN Integration**: Firebase Storage automatically distributes content via Google's global CDN, ensuring fast downloads worldwide.

**Comparison of storage options:**

- **Firebase Storage**:
  - Pros: Seamless integration with Firebase ecosystem, security rules aligned with Firestore, automatic CDN distribution
  - Cons: Less feature-rich than S3 for advanced use cases, potentially higher costs at very large scale

- **Amazon S3**:
  - Pros: Industry standard with extensive features, potentially more cost-effective at large scale, broader ecosystem of tools
  - Cons: Requires separate integration with authentication system, more complex setup, no built-in security rules

- **Supabase Storage**:
  - Pros: Integration with Supabase ecosystem, PostgreSQL-based permissions
  - Cons: Less mature than alternatives, smaller community and support ecosystem, less global distribution optimization

### 4. Implementation Plan

**High-level overview of database and storage structure:**

The Collab Workspace App implements a hierarchical data structure with the following components:

1. **Authentication Layer**:
   - Firebase Authentication manages user identities, login sessions, and tokens
   - User profiles are stored in both Auth user records and a dedicated Firestore collection

2. **Database Structure**:
   ```
   /users/{userId}
     - email
     - displayName
     - photoURL
     - createdAt
     - lastActive

   /workspaces/{workspaceId}
     - name
     - description
     - createdBy (userId)
     - members (array of userIds)
     - createdAt
     - updatedAt

   /boards/{boardId}
     - name
     - description
     - workspaceId (reference)
     - createdBy (userId)
     - createdAt
     - updatedAt

   /tasks/{taskId}
     - title
     - description
     - status ('todo', 'in-progress', 'done')
     - boardId (reference)
     - assignedTo (userId, optional)
     - createdBy (userId)
     - createdAt
     - updatedAt
     - attachments (array of attachment references)
   
   /attachments/{attachmentId}
     - name
     - type
     - size
     - taskId (reference)
     - uploadedBy (userId)
     - uploadedAt
     - storageRef (reference to Firebase Storage)
   ```

3. **Storage Structure**:
   - Files are stored in Firebase Storage with the following path pattern:
     ```
     /workspaces/{workspaceId}/boards/{boardId}/tasks/{taskId}/attachments/{filename}
     ```
   - This hierarchical structure mirrors the database organization and simplifies security rule implementation
   - Metadata about attachments is stored in Firestore, while the actual files reside in Firebase Storage

4. **Connection Flow**:
   - The React application connects to Firebase services through the Firebase SDK
   - Authentication state is managed globally using Zustand store (useAuthStore)
   - Upon authentication, the app subscribes to relevant data based on user permissions
   - Real-time listeners maintain synchronized state across all connected clients
   - File uploads/downloads are handled directly between the client and Firebase Storage
   - Security rules ensure users can only access data and files they have permission for

This structure provides a scalable, secure foundation that supports the collaborative features of the application while maintaining performance and data integrity.

## Technical Questions

### 1. Backend Architecture

**Scaling to 1 million users:**

To scale the Collab Workspace App to support 1 million users, I would implement the following architectural enhancements:

1. **Database Sharding and Indexing**:
   - Implement strategic Firestore collection sharding based on access patterns
   - Create composite indexes for frequently queried fields
   - Use subcollections to limit document size and improve query performance

2. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Implement a multi-level caching strategy:
     - Client-side caching for frequently accessed data
     - Redis or Memcached for server-side caching of common queries
     - CDN caching for static assets and public content

3. **Serverless Function Optimization**:
   - Split monolithic functions into microservices based on domain boundaries
   - Implement function specialization (read-optimized vs. write-optimized)
   - Use Cloud Tasks or Pub/Sub for asynchronous processing of non-critical operations

4. **Global Distribution**:
   - Leverage Firebase's multi-region deployment for global data distribution
   - Implement geolocation-based routing to direct users to the nearest region
   - Use Cloud Functions regional deployment to minimize latency

5. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**:
   - Implement client-side rate limiting to prevent API abuse
   - Use Firebase App Check to verify legitimate clients
   - Add server-side throttling for expensive operations

6. **Optimized Data Access Patterns**:
   - Implement pagination for large data sets
   - Use cursor-based pagination instead of offset-based for better performance
   - Denormalize data strategically to reduce join operations

7. **Background Processing**:
   - Move intensive operations to background processes
   - Implement a job queue for tasks like report generation, bulk operations
   - Use scheduled functions for maintenance tasks

8. **Monitoring and Alerting**:
   - Set up comprehensive monitoring using Firebase Performance Monitoring
   - Implement custom metrics for business-critical operations
   - Create alerting thresholds for abnormal patterns

9. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Implement tiered service levels based on workspace activity
   - Optimize read/write operations to minimize database costs
   - Use Firebase Storage lifecycle policies for attachment management

10. **Horizontal Scaling**:
    - Leverage Firebase's built-in horizontal scaling
    - For custom services, implement containerization with Kubernetes
    - Use load balancing for any custom API endpoints

This architecture would maintain the benefits of Firebase's serverless model while addressing the specific challenges of scaling to 1 million users.

### 2. Authentication Strategy

**Securing authentication in a mobile/web app:**

For the Collab Workspace App, I would implement the following authentication security measures:

1. **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**:
   - Offer optional MFA using SMS, email, or authenticator apps
   - Require MFA for sensitive operations (e.g., changing security settings)

2. **Secure Token Storage**:
   - Web: Store tokens in HttpOnly cookies with Secure and SameSite flags
   - Mobile: Use secure storage options (Keychain for iOS, EncryptedSharedPreferences for Android)
   - Never store tokens in localStorage or standard SharedPreferences

3. **Certificate Pinning**:
   - Implement certificate pinning in mobile apps to prevent MITM attacks
   - Include backup pins to prevent app lockout during certificate rotation

4. **Biometric Authentication**:
   - Integrate with platform biometric APIs (FaceID, TouchID, Fingerprint)
   - Use biometrics as a second factor or for re-authentication

5. **Brute Force Protection**:
   - Implement progressive delays after failed login attempts
   - Temporary account lockout after multiple failures
   - Email notifications for suspicious login attempts

6. **Device Management**:
   - Allow users to view and manage active sessions
   - Provide the ability to remotely log out from other devices
   - Track and display device information for active sessions

7. **Secure Registration**:
   - Implement email verification
   - Check passwords against known breach databases

8. **Regular Security Audits**:
   - Conduct penetration testing focused on authentication
   - Implement logging for all authentication events
   - Review authentication logs for suspicious patterns

**Token expiration and refresh flows:**

For token management, I would implement the following strategy:

1. **Token Structure**:
   - Use Firebase Authentication's JWT tokens
   - Short-lived access tokens (1 hour expiration)
   - Longer-lived refresh tokens (2 weeks expiration)
   - Include essential claims (user ID, roles, permissions)

2. **Refresh Flow**:
   - Implement a proactive refresh strategy:
     ```javascript
     // Refresh token when it's close to expiration (e.g., 5 minutes before)
     const tokenExpirationTime = jwtDecode(currentToken).exp * 1000;
     const refreshBuffer = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes in milliseconds
     
     if (Date.now() >= tokenExpirationTime - refreshBuffer) {
       // Refresh the token
       await refreshAccessToken();
     }
     ```

3. **Background Refresh**:
   - Implement silent refresh in web apps using hidden iframes or service workers
   - For mobile, use background services to maintain token freshness

4. **Handling Failures**:
   - Implement exponential backoff for refresh attempts
   - Redirect to login when refresh token is invalid or expired
   - Preserve user state to restore session after successful re-authentication

5. **Security Considerations**:
   - Invalidate all tokens when a user changes password
   - Implement token revocation on logout
   - Maintain a token blacklist for compromised tokens

6. **Cross-device Synchronization**:
   - Broadcast logout events across devices using Firebase Realtime Database
   - Implement a "force logout from all devices" feature for security incidents

This comprehensive approach ensures secure authentication while maintaining a smooth user experience across devices and sessions.

### 3. Database Modeling

**Database relationships design:**

For the Collab Workspace App, I would design the database relationships as follows:

1. **Users Collection**:
   ```javascript
   {
     id: "user123", // Document ID = Firebase Auth UID
     email: "user@example.com",
     displayName: "John Doe",
     photoURL: "https://example.com/photo.jpg",
     createdAt: Timestamp,
     settings: {
       notifications: true,
       theme: "light"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Workspaces Collection**:
   ```javascript
   {
     id: "workspace456", // Document ID
     name: "Marketing Team",
     description: "Workspace for marketing team projects",
     createdBy: "user123", // Reference to Users
     members: {
       "user123": { role: "admin", joinedAt: Timestamp },
       "user789": { role: "member", joinedAt: Timestamp }
     },
     createdAt: Timestamp,
     updatedAt: Timestamp
   }
   ```

3. **Boards Collection**:
   ```javascript
   {
     id: "board789", // Document ID
     name: "Q3 Campaign",
     description: "Planning for Q3 marketing campaign",
     workspaceId: "workspace456", // Reference to Workspaces
     createdBy: "user123", // Reference to Users
     createdAt: Timestamp,
     updatedAt: Timestamp
   }
   ```

4. **Tasks Collection**:
   ```javascript
   {
     id: "task101", // Document ID
     title: "Create social media graphics",
     description: "Design graphics for Facebook and Instagram",
     status: "in-progress", // Enum: "todo", "in-progress", "done"
     boardId: "board789", // Reference to Boards
     assignedTo: "user789", // Reference to Users
     createdBy: "user123", // Reference to Users
     priority: "high", // Enum: "low", "medium", "high"
     dueDate: Timestamp,
     tags: ["design", "social-media"],
     attachments: [
       {
         id: "attach1",
         name: "draft-design.png",
         type: "image/png",
         size: 1024000,
         storageRef: "workspaces/workspace456/boards/board789/tasks/task101/draft-design.png",
         uploadedAt: Timestamp
       }
     ],
     createdAt: Timestamp,
     updatedAt: Timestamp
   }
   ```

5. **Comments Subcollection** (under Tasks):
   ```javascript
   {
     id: "comment1", // Document ID
     taskId: "task101", // Reference to parent Task
     content: "I've started working on this",
     createdBy: "user789", // Reference to Users
     createdAt: Timestamp,
     updatedAt: Timestamp
   }
   ```

6. **Activity Collection** (for audit trail):
   ```javascript
   {
     id: "activity1", // Document ID
     entityType: "task", // Enum: "workspace", "board", "task"
     entityId: "task101", // Reference to entity
     action: "status_changed", // Enum of possible actions
     oldValue: "todo",
     newValue: "in-progress",
     performedBy: "user789", // Reference to Users
     timestamp: Timestamp
   }
   ```

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Denormalization Strategy**:
   - Store member information directly in the workspace document for quick access control checks
   - Include basic attachment metadata in the task document to avoid extra queries
   - Store task status directly in the task document for efficient filtering

2. **References vs. Embedding**:
   - Use references (IDs) for one-to-many relationships
   - Embed small, frequently accessed data that changes together with the parent
   - Use subcollections for comments to keep task documents from growing too large

3. **Query Optimization**:
   - Design structure to support common queries:
     - "Get all workspaces for a user" (via members field)
     - "Get all boards in a workspace" (via workspaceId)
     - "Get all tasks in a board" (via boardId)
     - "Get all tasks assigned to a user" (via assignedTo)

4. **Security Considerations**:
   - Structure supports granular security rules:
     - Users can only access workspaces they're members of
     - Workspace access automatically grants access to its boards and tasks
     - Task assignment doesn't require full workspace membership

This data model balances normalization and denormalization to optimize for the most common access patterns while maintaining data integrity and supporting the security model.

### 4. State Management (Frontend)

**Comparison of state management solutions:**

For React applications like the Collab Workspace App, here's a comparison of popular state management solutions:

1. **Redux**:
   - **Pros**: Predictable state updates, robust middleware ecosystem, excellent DevTools, time-travel debugging
   - **Cons**: Verbose boilerplate, steep learning curve, complex setup for async operations
   - **Best for**: Large applications with complex state interactions, when team is already familiar with Redux

2. **Zustand**:
   - **Pros**: Minimal boilerplate, intuitive API, built-in immer integration, TypeScript support, small bundle size
   - **Cons**: Less established ecosystem, fewer middleware options, simpler DevTools than Redux
   - **Best for**: Small to medium applications, teams that prefer simplicity, projects that need quick setup

3. **Recoil**:
   - **Pros**: Atom-based approach, React-specific optimizations, fine-grained reactivity, good for complex derived state
   - **Cons**: Still evolving API, Facebook-dependent future, more complex than Zustand for basic use cases
   - **Best for**: Applications with complex state dependencies, when atomic state updates are important

4. **Context API with useReducer**:
   - **Pros**: Built into React, no additional dependencies, familiar Redux-like patterns with useReducer
   - **Cons**: Performance concerns with large state objects, no built-in middleware, manual optimization needed
   - **Best for**: Simple applications, component-specific state, when bundle size is critical

**Preference for this project:**

For the Collab Workspace App, **Zustand** is the preferred state management solution for the following reasons:

1. **Simplicity and Developer Experience**:
   - Zustand's minimal API reduces boilerplate and cognitive load
   - The learning curve is significantly lower than Redux or Recoil
   - Creating and updating stores is intuitive and requires less code

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Zustand only re-renders components when their specific subscribed state changes
   - It uses the React batching mechanism efficiently
   - Selective state subscription is simple with its selector pattern

3. **Firebase Integration**:
   - Zustand works well with Firebase's real-time listeners
   - Example implementation:
     ```javascript
     // Store definition
     export const useTasksStore = create((set) => ({
       tasks: [],
       isLoading: false,
       error: null,
       
       fetchTasks: async (boardId) => {
         set({ isLoading: true, error: null });
         try {
           // Set up real-time listener
           const q = query(collection(db, 'tasks'), where('boardId', '==', boardId));
           const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(q, (snapshot) => {
             const tasks = snapshot.docs.map(doc => ({ id: doc.id, ...doc.data() }));
             set({ tasks, isLoading: false });
           }, (error) => {
             set({ error: error.message, isLoading: false });
           });
           
           // Store unsubscribe function for cleanup
           set(state => ({ ...state, unsubscribe }));
         } catch (error) {
           set({ error: error.message, isLoading: false });
         }
       },
       
       // Other actions...
     }));
     ```

4. **TypeScript Integration**:
   - Zustand has excellent TypeScript support out of the box
   - Type inference works well with minimal type declarations

5. **Middleware When Needed**:
   - Zustand offers middleware for persistence, devtools, and immer integration
   - These can be added incrementally as needed without complex setup

6. **Bundle Size**:
   - Zustand's small footprint (less than 1KB) keeps the application bundle size minimal

7. **Testing Simplicity**:
   - Zustand stores are easier to mock and test than more complex state solutions

For a collaborative application like this, where real-time updates and optimized rendering are important, Zustand provides the right balance of simplicity, performance, and features.

### 5. Offline Handling

**Implementing offline support:**

For the Collab Workspace App, I would implement a comprehensive offline strategy using the following approach:

1. **Firestore Offline Persistence**:
   - Enable Firestore's built-in offline persistence:
     ```javascript
     // In firebase.ts
     import { enableMultiTabIndexedDbPersistence } from 'firebase/firestore';
     
     const db = getFirestore(app);
     try {
       // Enable offline persistence
       enableMultiTabIndexedDbPersistence(db);
     } catch (error) {
       console.error("Error enabling offline persistence:", error);
     }
     ```
   - This automatically caches Firestore data for offline access and handles synchronization when connectivity is restored

2. **Optimistic UI Updates**:
   - Implement optimistic updates for immediate user feedback:
     ```javascript
     const addTask = async (taskData) => {
       // Generate a temporary ID
       const tempId = 'temp_' + Date.now();
       
       // Optimistically update UI
       set(state => ({
         tasks: [...state.tasks, { id: tempId, ...taskData, pending: true }]
       }));
       
       try {
         // Attempt to save to Firestore
         const docRef = await addDoc(collection(db, 'tasks'), taskData);
         
         // Update with real ID on success
         set(state => ({
           tasks: state.tasks.map(task => 
             task.id === tempId ? { ...task, id: docRef.id, pending: false } : task
           )
         }));
       } catch (error) {
         // Mark as failed but keep in UI
         set(state => ({
           tasks: state.tasks.map(task => 
             task.id === tempId ? { ...task, error: error.message } : task
           )
         }));
       }
     };
     ```

3. **Connectivity Monitoring**:
   - Implement a connectivity monitor to inform users of their offline status:
     ```javascript
     const useConnectivityStatus = () => {
       const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(navigator.onLine);
       
       useEffect(() => {
         const handleOnline = () => setIsOnline(true);
         const handleOffline = () => setIsOnline(false);
         
         window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);
         window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
         
         return () => {
           window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);
           window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
         };
       }, []);
       
       return isOnline;
     };
     ```

4. **Offline Indicators**:
   - Display clear UI indicators when working offline:
     ```jsx
     const ConnectivityBanner = () => {
       const isOnline = useConnectivityStatus();
       
       if (isOnline) return null;
       
       return (
         <div className="bg-yellow-100 p-2 text-center">
           You're currently offline. Changes will sync when you reconnect.
         </div>
       );
     };
     ```

5. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Implement a strategy for handling conflicts during synchronization:
     ```javascript
     const updateTask = async (taskId, updates) => {
       // Store the update timestamp
       const clientUpdatedAt = Timestamp.now();
       
       // Get the current task
       const taskRef = doc(db, 'tasks', taskId);
       const taskSnap = await getDoc(taskRef);
       
       if (taskSnap.exists()) {
         const currentTask = taskSnap.data();
         
         // Check if the server version is newer than our last known version
         if (currentTask.updatedAt && currentTask.updatedAt > clientUpdatedAt) {
           // Conflict detected - implement resolution strategy
           // Options:
           // 1. Server wins (discard client changes)
           // 2. Client wins (overwrite server)
           // 3. Merge changes (more complex)
           // 4. Present conflict to user
           
           // For this example, we'll use a "last write wins" approach
           await updateDoc(taskRef, {
             ...updates,
             updatedAt: clientUpdatedAt
           });
         } else {
           // No conflict, proceed with update
           await updateDoc(taskRef, {
             ...updates,
             updatedAt: clientUpdatedAt
           });
         }
       }
     };
     ```

6. **Offline File Handling**:
   - For file attachments, implement a queue system:
     ```javascript
     const uploadQueue = create((set, get) => ({
       queue: [],
       
       addToQueue: (file, taskId) => {
         set(state => ({
           queue: [...state.queue, { file, taskId, status: 'pending' }]
         }));
       },
       
       processQueue: async () => {
         const isOnline = navigator.onLine;
         if (!isOnline) return;
         
         const { queue } = get();
         
         // Process each pending upload
         for (let i = 0; i < queue.length; i++) {
           const item = queue[i];
           if (item.status !== 'pending') continue;
           
           // Mark as processing
           set(state => ({
             queue: state.queue.map((q, idx) => 
               idx === i ? { ...q, status: 'processing' } : q
             )
           }));
           
           try {
             // Upload to Firebase Storage
             const storageRef = ref(storage, `tasks/${item.taskId}/${item.file.name}`);
             await uploadBytes(storageRef, item.file);
             
             // Mark as complete
             set(state => ({
               queue: state.queue.map((q, idx) => 
                 idx === i ? { ...q, status: 'complete' } : q
               )
             }));
           } catch (error) {
             // Mark as failed
             set(state => ({
               queue: state.queue.map((q, idx) => 
                 idx === i ? { ...q, status: 'failed', error: error.message } : q
               )
             }));
           }
         }
         
         // Clean up completed items
         set(state => ({
           queue: state.queue.filter(item => item.status !== 'complete')
         }));
       }
     }));
     
     // Process queue when coming online
     useEffect(() => {
       const handleOnline = () => {
         uploadQueue.getState().processQueue();
       };
       
       window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);
       return () => window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);
     }, []);
     ```

7. **Service Worker for Web**:
   - Implement a service worker for caching application assets:
     ```javascript
     // In service-worker.js
     self.addEventListener('install', (event) => {
       event.waitUntil(
         caches.open('app-shell-v1').then((cache) => {
           return cache.addAll([
             '/',
             '/index.html',
             '/static/js/main.js',
             '/static/css/main.css',
             // Other app assets
           ]);
         })
       );
     });
     
     self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
       event.respondWith(
         caches.match(event.request).then((response) => {
           return response || fetch(event.request);
         })
       );
     });
     ```

8. **Sync Indicators**:
   - Provide visual feedback about synchronization status:
     ```jsx
     const SyncStatus = () => {
       const pendingChanges = usePendingChangesCount();
       
       if (pendingChanges === 0) {
         return <span className="text-green-500">All changes saved</span>;
       }
       
       return (
         <span className="text-yellow-500">
           Syncing {pendingChanges} {pendingChanges === 1 ? 'change' : 'changes'}...
         </span>
       );
     };
     ```

9. **Data Prioritization**:
   - Implement strategies to prioritize critical data for offline access:
     ```javascript
     // Prefetch important data for offline access
     const prefetchCriticalData = async (userId) => {
       // Fetch user's workspaces
       const workspacesQuery = query(
         collection(db, 'workspaces'),
         where('members', 'array-contains', userId)
       );
       await getDocs(workspacesQuery);
       
       // Fetch recent boards
       const recentBoardsQuery = query(
         collection(db, 'boards'),
         where('createdBy', '==', userId),
         orderBy('updatedAt', 'desc'),
         limit(5)
       );
       await getDocs(recentBoardsQuery);
       
       // Fetch recent tasks
       const recentTasksQuery = query(
         collection(db, 'tasks'),
         where('assignedTo', '==', userId),
         orderBy('updatedAt', 'desc'),
         limit(20)
       );
       await getDocs(recentTasksQuery);
     };
     ```

This comprehensive approach ensures that users can continue working seamlessly when offline, with clear indicators of their connectivity status and automatic synchronization when they reconnect.
